# Warning #
This is the latest version that still possibly is under development. Do not download this version unless you know what you are doing.

This version might contain bugs and features that are not fully tested. I do not recommend this download to people that don't know how to fix possible problems that this version has.
However this download will also be useful to who want to get the latests features added to the repository.

# Details #
To get it, you need to have a SVN client.

This is the command that you'll need in order to checkout:
```

svn checkout http://mod-random-article.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mod-random-article
```

After the checkout, you'll only need to zip all the files inside that folder and use that zip file to install the module on Joomla's Extension Manager.
